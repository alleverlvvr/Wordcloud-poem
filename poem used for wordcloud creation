A gale of freshness gushes in
When I think about those days,
Back when the tiny me existed
In my little world, full of joy.
The grown up me still misses
Those childhood friends
Peddling around and playing cricket.
Misses the streets, the park, the swings.
That huge area to play
Yet going for the stony roads
Had a fall, broke my left arm.
The feeling was driving me
Not the pain, the thirst for thrills
Which still persists.
Misses the boy, who loved to sing
Loved coming to light.
Not so shy, the open me,
Enchanting shlokas on stage,
When mum dressed me up as a priest
In that absurd fancy dress.
Unlike kids nowadays
Wanting whatever they see
I used to be satisfied with a bottle of milk
For walking through the market with parents
Making the glitters fail to attract.
That sense of responsibility I learnt
When mum used to give father's lunchbox
To be delivered.To him, by me.
And among those small missions
For bringing the ball back
When it flew off the boundaries.
That brave boy I miss
Eager to discover new places
Which seemed ghostly
And face the fears I had
With a smile so innocent.
Those were the days
When going to school was fun
And holidays meant tours and trips
With friends and family, and my mind
As carefree as the wind
Fooling around with my orange cap
And those weird looking sunglasses.
Oh how shall I forget!
About the thunder of joy that roared
When I saw a snowfall for the first time!
Me, playing with snowballs
And that ugly, yet friendly snowman I made.
I remember watching my mother
Making all those delicacies
And all I felt, was the joy in breeze
Calling in the festivals.
How delicious the Horlicks tasted
Back when I used to steal,
Climbing stools and chairs to reach.
I wish I could live in these memories.
Now I feel the freshness die out
As my mature mind acclaims
Those days, my boy, are gone.
Those days of my lovely childhood!
