# Wordcloud-poem
Wordcloud using python jupyter notebook coded as part of Crash Course on Python by Google on Coursera. 
This code provided here has taken cue from https://github.com/PiyushKhanna30/Word-Cloud and thus the credits to him as due. 
However the idea was implemented on my own for the desired output.
